# GUVI-NLP_Sentiment-Analysis

Streamlit project to do NLP sentiment analysis 

(Note: entire project is done in 1 python file(aiecho.py))

Step 1: This involves processing of data(chatgpt_style_reviews_dataset.csv) mainly by stemming and lemmatizing.

Step 2: Next step is staring to code for streamlit alongside modelling but starting with the sidebar with "Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)", "Sentiment Analysis Insights", "Model Training and Evaluation" and "Try Your Own Review" options all of which denote each page

Step 3: Starting with Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA), This page is to show all the eda analysis done for this dataset and we can find the selections for it in the selectbox on top of the graphs.

Step 4: For Sentiment Analysis Insights, the page answers the questions given in the project and we can find the selections for the questions in the selectbox on top of the graphs

Step 5: For Model Training and Evaluation, we do logistic regression,native bayes and random forest with review and sentiment with 80/20 split on training and testing. And this is shown in streamlit with model evaluation metrics that show accuracy, precision etc , a confusion matrix for the model for the data

Step 6: For Try your own review tab, it is to predict the input given by the user whether its positive review or negative and we can choose between the 3 models of logistic regression, native bayes and random forest
